### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that an API is a type of rules for accessing a Web-based software application. Companies like Google release their API to the public. That way, other software developers can design new products that also use its service.
2. I learned that developers can make HTTP requests by calling methods in their code. The 3rd party API must be called with the proper syntax, which can be found in the documentation made available by the API providers.
3. I learned that AJAX is actually an acronym meaning Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. This technology allows us to load data from the server without refreshing the browser page.
